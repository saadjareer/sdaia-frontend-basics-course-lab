        <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
        <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a markup language used to structure and format content on the web. It
            uses a system of tags to define the different elements of a web page, such as headings, paragraphs, and

        <h3>Creating an HTML Document</h3>
        <p>To create an HTML document, you will need a text editor and a web browser. You can use a simple text editor
            like Notepad on Windows, or TextEdit on Mac. Once you have a text editor, you can create a new HTML document
            by saving a file with the ".html" extension.</p>
